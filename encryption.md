# Encryption & Security Concepts

- Symmetric encryption: same key to encrypt/decrypt
- Asymmetric encryption: public/private key pairs
- Hashing: one-way function to verify integrity
- TLS / HTTPS: secure communication over the internet
- Password storage: hashed and salted for security

Goal: Understand how encryption protects data and users
